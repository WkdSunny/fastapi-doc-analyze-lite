        For each piece of information:
        - If explicitly stated in the document, extract it exactly as written.
        - For each item that is found return the the text that has been used to match the item in Matching Key.
        - If, for any item, the value is callucated using any given data, provide the formula used to calculate as the value in the Addl. Comments.
        - If, for any item, there is a specific condition to determine the value, provide the condition as the value in the Addl. Comments.
        - For Point 13. There can also be some additional % (percentage) added to it. If yes then calculate it.
        - For point 41. Pick any or all available comments and merge them with newline under point 41. Comments/Notes/Remarks. Don't exclude anything even if some part of the comment has already been used in any other item. But don't use comment from Flood Certificate.
        - If any information can be calculated from given data, perform the calculation and provide the result.
        - If not found or cannot be determined, use "N/A" as the value.
        - If 36. Flood Hazard Area not found check 35. Flood Zone. If the value of 35. Flood Zone contains alpbhabet either A or V, value of 36. Flood Hazard Area should be Yes else No.
        - Consider "Coverage" and "Limit" as synonames. So if an item has Coverage or Limit written and you get a value, usually number and can be prefixed with $ (dollar) after the word Limit or Coverage consider it as the Coverage for the item found at the begining or near to begining of the line
        - Most of the items starting from 13 to 26 usually has a DED or Deduction item. DED and Deduction both are same. Consider that as a part of DED of that section and add them to the respective DED items, like "15. Business Income DED", "23. Equipment Breakdown DED", "26. Earth Movement DED", "40. Flood DED", etc.

        Organize the data into a table with the following headers:
        Information Key|Matching Key|Matching Value|Value|Addl. Comments
        Final Output should be csv of that table. Use "|" (pipe) as delimiter.

        Task: Carefully read through the content and extract -
            1. Anything and everything that you think is important and useful.
            2. Any information that you think is relevant and can be used to make a decision or take an action.
            3. Put extra care to extact any notes or comments which can be either handwritten or typed.
            4. Put extra care on texts like "Comment", "Note", "Important", "Special", "Remark", etc. treat them as important and 
               extract the information following them.
            5. If you find a table or list extract them and parse them carefully in the requested response format.
            6. If you find name and address of any person or organization, extract them.
                6.1. Seperate the name and address into different fields.
                6.2. Further seperate the address into street, city, state, zip code, country, etc.
                6.3. Use state abbreviations instead of their full name. 
                     For example, you should change "Texas" to "TX", "Colorado" to "CO", "North Carolina" to "NC", and so on.
                6.4. Use country abbreviations instead of their full name which should be IATA compliant.
                     For example, you should change "England" to "UK", "Canada" to "CN", "India" to "IN", and so on.
            7. If you find any date or time, extract them and try to asign them to the correct field or metric.
               For example -
                    a. you get a text "Date of Birth: 01/01/2000", extract the date and assign it to the field "Date of Birth".
                    b. you get a text "Date of Issue: 01/01/2022", extract the date and assign it to the field "Date of Issue".
                    c. you get a text "Time of Arrival: 10:00 AM", extract the time and assign it to the field "Time of Arrival".

        - In case of conflicting information, use the information that you think is most relevant and useful.
            + Make sure to provide a reason or explanation in the "Addl. Comments" field.
            + Match the conflicting information with their keys, matching keys, values and matching values before making a decision.
            + Check additional information can be interpreted from the conflicting information.

        Organize the data into a table with the following headers:

        - Matching Key: The key that was used to match the information in the content.
        - Matching Value: The value that was used to match the information in the content.
        - Value: The extracted value of the information.
        - Addl. Comments: Any additional comments or notes that you think are relevant.
        - Information Key and Value shall be used to populate a form.
        - Matching Key and Matching Value shall be used to match the information in the content and anotate the original document using bounding boxes.
        - Text property of a bounding box shall be matched against the Matching Value & Matching Key to find out relevant bounding box.
        Final Output should be csv of that table. Use "|" (pipe) as delimiter.
